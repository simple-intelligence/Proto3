1. Get IMU input over I2C(?) interface.
2. Use Extended Kalman Filter(?) to denoise input
3. Set up mock PID system without motor output
4. Set up motor output

Overall Architecture Plan:
    Should be able to keep flight control portion of quad fairly seperate. Can use ZMQ to communicate controller/AI inputs.
    Use controller inputs to modify PID setpoints? (Look up rate and attitude mode more)
    Write flight control platform in C++/Arduino
